# Engine Moisture Monitor — Home Assistant integration

A native Home Assistant integration that hosts the canonical engine-moisture physics
model (`../../scripts/model.py`) and turns your X-Sense cowl temp/RH history into
cam-wetness sensors plus an optional "want to go flying?" Telegram nudge.

Unlike the old AppDaemon app, **everything is GUI-driven**:

- **Schedule** → the `Run cycle every (minutes)` option (or call the service from any
  automation/dashboard button).
- **Parameters** → one Options form (Settings → Devices & Services → Engine Moisture
  Monitor → **Configure**): model τ's, flight-detection, alert thresholds, quiet hours,
  chart history, notification plumbing.
- **Manual trigger** → the `engine_moisture.run_now` service (with optional `force` to
  send the nudge regardless of thresholds/quiet-hours/cooldown).
- **Run history** → native entity **History/Logbook** + automation **Traces**, plus a
  diagnostic *Last model run* sensor.

The physics stay the single source of truth in `scripts/` — this integration imports
them, never copies them. A `git pull` on the repo updates the model.

## Install

1. **Deploy the repo on the HA box** (for `scripts/`), e.g. clone to
   `/config/lyc-engine-moisture-exposure-analysis` (the integration auto-detects this
   path; otherwise set the `scripts_dir` option or `LYC_SCRIPTS_DIR`).
2. **Copy the integration** `custom_components/engine_moisture/` into
   `/config/custom_components/engine_moisture/` (symlink to the repo copy if you prefer
   `git pull` to update both).
3. **Restart Home Assistant.** On first load it installs `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
   (declared in `manifest.json`) — the first restart may take a few minutes.
4. **Add it:** Settings → Devices & Services → **Add Integration** → *Engine Moisture
   Monitor*. Pick your cowl temperature and humidity sensors, unit, home airport, and
   lat/lon/timezone.
5. **Tune it:** open **Configure** to adjust schedule, parameters, and alert thresholds.

## Notifications (optional, for the nudge)

- **Telegram:** have the `telegram_bot` integration set up; put your chat id in the
  `Telegram chat id` option (blank = broadcast to configured chats).
- **Flying-window text (Gemini):** add the *Google Generative AI* / AI Task integration;
  the default AI Task entity is `ai_task.google_ai_task` (change via the option). If it's
  unavailable the nudge falls back to a deterministic window line — it never goes silent.
- **Charts** are written to the `Chart output directory` (default
  `/homeassistant/www/moisture`) and attached to the Telegram message. The alert chart
  shows ~2.5 months of history with each detected flight marked and the wet+close-hours
  line reset at every flight, so you can see how exposure built up and was purged.

## Entities

- `sensor.*_cam_wet_hours_since_last_flight` (film hours; attrs: days, realistic/UB
  hours, sub-dew/close-call hours, last flight, latest reading)
- `sensor.*_days_since_last_flight`
- `sensor.*_last_engine_run` (+ `flight_count`)
- `sensor.*_last_model_run` (diagnostic; + `last_alert`)
- `binary_sensor.*_cam_grounding_caution` (data-aware "fly monthly"; attrs: reason, wet
  hours, days grounded)

## Test it

Fire the service from Developer Tools → Actions:

```yaml
action: engine_moisture.run_now
data:
  force: true
```

Confirm the sensors update and (if Telegram is configured) one message with the summary
chart arrives. For offline/CLI testing without HA, see `../../homeassistant/`.
